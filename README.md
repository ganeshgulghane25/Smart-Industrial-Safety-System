# 🏭 Smart Industrial Safety & Automation System

A **Smart Industrial Safety and Automation System** designed using **Arduino UNO**, **MQ2 gas sensor**, and **DHT11 temperature sensor**.  
The system continuously monitors environmental gas and temperature levels and automatically activates a **relay-controlled fan**, **buzzer**, and **LED** when unsafe conditions are detected.  
This project was designed, tested, and simulated in **Proteus**, and is ready for **real-world IoT integration**.
